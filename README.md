# Basic_stopwatch

A simple stopwatch application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project is part of my learning journey in JavaScript, inspired by tutorials from Super Simple Dev.

### Features
- Start, Pause, and Reset buttons to control the stopwatch.
- Display of elapsed time in hours, minutes, and seconds.
- Simple and minimalist design using basic CSS.

### How It Works
- The stopwatch starts counting time from 0:0:0 when the "Start" button is pressed.
- You can pause the stopwatch by clicking the "Stop" button.
- The "Reset" button will stop the stopwatch and reset the time back to 0:0:0.

### Technologies Used
- HTML for structuring the webpage.
- CSS for basic styling of the stopwatch layout.
- JavaScript for the stopwatch functionality (handling time, start, stop, and reset).
